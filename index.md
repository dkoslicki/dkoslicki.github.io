I am a computational biologist interested in developing mathematically sound approaches to the analysis of high-throughput 
DNA sequencing data. To do this, I utilize and develop techniques from the fields of probability, compressed sensing, and 
optimization. I am particularly interested in developing methods to analyze genomic and metagenomic data.

I have recently moved to [Penn State University](https://www.psu.edu/) where 
[I am an Associate Professor](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/departments/directory-detail-g.aspx?q=dmk333) of Computer Science 
and Engineering, Biology, and the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences. As such, this website is a work in progress. My 
old website (at Oregon State University, Mathematics Department) can be accessed [here](https://koslicki.math.oregonstate.edu/).
